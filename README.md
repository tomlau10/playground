## projects
- **2011-06-mastermind**
  - This is a mastermind game that I developed while learning Pascal in high school.

- **2011-12-snake**
  - An enhanced version of a snake game [sourced online](https://pascal.sources.ru/gamestxt/turbogam.htm) using Pascal. This is no ordinary snake game but you control the character that will be chased by the snake, and the goal is to collect as much money as possible before being caught! Added helpful items to aid the character's survival, a survival mode that starts directly in the highest difficulty, and included a highscore function to store player scores.
