## projects
- **2011-06-mastermind**
  - This is a mastermind game that I developed while learning Pascal in high school.

- **2011-12-snake**
  - An enhanced version of a snake game [sourced online](https://pascal.sources.ru/gamestxt/turbogam.htm) using Pascal. This is no ordinary snake game but you control the character that will be chased by the snake, and the goal is to collect as much money as possible before being caught! Added helpful items to aid the character's survival, a survival mode that starts directly in the highest difficulty, and included a highscore function to store player scores.

- **2012-06-SpaceWar**
  - An iOS game app created during an iPhone App Workshop.

- **2014-08-minesweeper**
  - Created during a university course focused on system programming, where I learned advanced console input/output techniques. The game is played entirely using keyboard inputs.

- **2014-08-snake-remastered**
  - A remastered version of the snake game mentioned earlier, ported to the C language. I modified the UI and used different console text colors to represent various items in the game.

- **2014-10-picross-solver**
  - Originally written in Lisp for a university course assignment, this picross solver was later optimized in C for improved performance. It is capable of solving medium-sized puzzles in just a few milliseconds. The largest puzzle I tested was 90x85 (I forgot the puzzle source...), which only took 10ms to solve!
